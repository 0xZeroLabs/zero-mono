description: Hijacking the internet to protect IP assets

<a href="https://story.foundation">Story</a>, a purpose-built protocol for
registering intellectual property (making IP programmable) has opened to doors
for the composability of a lot of IP asset, but a huge portion of existing IP
lie on the internet in silos and moving them verifiably, would require
cooperation from the various platforms. Most platforms are rent-seekers and have
no real incentive to protect their user's data, in fact, they're incentivised to
do the opposite.

Having identified this massive issue, the team at <a href="https://0xzero.org">ZERO Labs</a> decided to build a new protocol. One that is economically secured (through <a href="https://eigenlayer.xyz">EigenLayer</a>), that will enable developers in the Story ecosystem to leverage <a href="/web-proofs">Web Proofs</a> (zkTLS) to on-ramp already existing IP assets from web2 platforms unto Story.

<a href="https://github.com/0xzerolabs/the-forge">The Forge</a> became the first
step towards this goal. And now, creators across already existing platforms can
take their exisiting work and publish it to Story (to protect their IP, and
enable composability), while also being able to leverage the power of Web Proofs
to prove their ownership of their IP assets in a privacy preserving manner,
among other things.
