## Set up your Environment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the Othentic CLI">
    Make sure you're running the Node v22.6.0 (precisely), see [here](https://docs.othentic.xyz/main/avs-framework/quick-start#prerequisites):
    ```shell
    node -v
    ```

    If you don't have Node installed, you can download it through [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md/).

    Now run the installation command:
    ```shell
    npm i -g @othentic/othentic-cli
    ```

    Verify the installation by running:
    ```shell
    othentic-cli -v
    ```
    You should see an output similar to the below (version may vary based on releases):
    ```shell
    othentic-cli version 1.x.y
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Register as an Operator">
    The Othentic CLI provides commands for registering as an operator as well as managing your account:
    <Info>For Holesky, our AVS Governance address is: `0x87774A9Ae979aB1E77a78D11668B7a3Ee1F8ACe6`</Info>
    ```shell
    othentic-cli operator register
    ```
    Now, convert some of that ETH to stETH before depositing into EigenLayer:
    ```shell
    othentic-cli operator deposit --strategy stETH --shares 0.01 --convert 0.012
    ```
    Activate your Operator by depositing into EigenLayer. Deposit at least 0.01 stETH into EigenLayer pool:
    ```shell
    othentic-cli operator deposit --strategy stETH --shares 0.01
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="You're ready to opt-in to our AVS">
      Now all you need to do is follow our instructions to [run an AVS node](/operators/run-a-node) ðŸŽ‰.
  </Step>
