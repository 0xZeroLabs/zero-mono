## Set up your Environment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the Othentic CLI">
    Make sure you're running the latest version of Node.js:
    ```shell
    node -v
    ```

    If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

    Now run the installation command:
    ```shell
    npm install -g othentic-cli
    ```

    Verify the installation by running:
    ```shell
    othentic-cli -h
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Register as an Operator">
    The Othentic CLI provides commands for registering as an operator as well as managing your account:
    ```shell
    othentic-cli operator register
    ```
    Now, convert some of that ETH to stETH before depositing into EigenLayer:
    ```shell
    othentic-cli operator deposit --strategy stETH --shares 0.01 --convert 0.012
    ```
    Activate your Operator by depositing into EigenLayer. Deposit 0.01 stETH into EigenLayer pool:
    ```shell
    othentic-cli operator deposit --strategy stETH --shares 0.01
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="You're ready to opt-in to our AVS">
      Now all you need to do is follow our instructions to [run an AVS node](/operators/run-a-node) ðŸŽ‰.
